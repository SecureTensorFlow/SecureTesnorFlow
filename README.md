Vision

SecureTensorFlow aims to bridge the gap between advanced AI and stringent privacy requirements. By leveraging state-of-the-art cryptographic techniques and decentralized learning paradigms, we provide a framework that ensures data remains confidential while enabling scalable, high-accuracy machine learning. Our focus on medical imaging underscores our commitment to real-world impact, where privacy is paramount. We envision a future where AI is both powerful and inherently secure, fostering trust across industries.

Features

SecureTensorFlow offers a robust suite of capabilities tailored for privacy-preserving AI:





Lattice-Based Homomorphic Encryption: Utilizes the CKKS scheme for secure computation on encrypted tensors, supporting arithmetic operations on ciphertext with 2048-bit modulus for post-quantum security.



Federated Learning: Facilitates decentralized training across edge devices, employing secure multi-party computation for gradient aggregation, minimizing data exposure.



Differential Privacy: Implements fine-grained noise injection with Îµ=0.005, ensuring strong privacy guarantees for sensitive datasets like MRI scans.



GPU-Accelerated Tensor Operations: Harnesses CUDA-optimized kernels for encrypted tensor computations, achieving low-latency inference (45ms at Îµ=0.01).



PyTorch Compatibility: Integrates seamlessly with PyTorch, offering custom optimizers (e.g., SecureSGD) for encrypted gradient descent in existing ML pipelines.



Scalability and Efficiency: Processes large-scale datasets (up to 15TB) with 99.8% encryption efficiency in distributed environments.



Dynamic Privacy Adjustment: Adapts privacy parameters (Îµ) based on training dynamics, balancing accuracy and security.



Auditability: Provides cryptographic proofs of privacy compliance, verifiable by third-party auditors.

Architecture

SecureTensorFlowâ€™s modular architecture is designed for security, performance, and extensibility:





Encryption Core: Employs lattice-based homomorphic encryption to transform input tensors into ciphertext, enabling secure computation without decryption. The CKKS scheme supports approximate arithmetic for neural network operations.



Federated Orchestrator: Manages decentralized training across nodes, using a modified Paillier protocol for secure gradient aggregation. Ensures no raw data leaves local devices.



Tensor Processing Engine: Executes encrypted tensor operations via custom CUDA kernels, optimized for NVIDIA GPUs, reducing computational overhead.



Privacy Layer: Injects calibrated Gaussian noise to achieve differential privacy, with a dynamic scheduler to adjust Îµ based on convergence rates.



Model Interface: Exposes a PyTorch-compatible API for defining and training encrypted models, with support for convolutional and recurrent architectures.



Verification Module: Generates cryptographic proofs of correct execution and privacy compliance, stored in a tamper-proof ledger.
