Features





Homomorphic Encryption: Leverages lattice-based cryptography (e.g., CKKS scheme) for secure computation on encrypted tensors, ensuring data privacy during training.



Federated Learning: Enables decentralized model updates across edge devices, minimizing data exposure with secure aggregation protocols.



Differential Privacy: Guarantees Îµ=0.005 privacy loss, ideal for sensitive applications like medical imaging.



GPU Acceleration: Optimized tensor operations using CUDA for low-latency inference (45ms at Îµ=0.01).



PyTorch Integration: Seamless plugin for existing ML workflows, supporting custom encrypted optimizers (e.g., SecureSGD).



Scalability: Processes 15TB datasets with 99.8% encryption efficiency in distributed environments.

Architecture

SecureTensorFlowâ€™s architecture combines cryptographic and machine learning primitives for secure AI:





Encryption Layer: Lattice-based homomorphic encryption (2048-bit modulus) encrypts input tensors, enabling computation on ciphertext.



Federated Orchestrator: Coordinates secure gradient aggregation across nodes using a modified Paillier protocol.



Tensor Engine: GPU-accelerated tensor operations (via custom CUDA kernels) for encrypted gradient descent.



Privacy Module: Injects calibrated noise to ensure differential privacy, with dynamic Îµ adjustment.



Model Interface: PyTorch-compatible API for encrypted model training and inference.

Installation



Note: SecureTensorFlow is in beta. The following instructions are for the preview release.

Prerequisites





Python 3.8+



PyTorch 2.0.1



CUDA 11.7 (for GPU support)



LibLattice 1.2.0 (fictional cryptography library)

Steps





Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/SecureTensorFlow/SecureTensorFlow.git
cd SecureTensorFlow



Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt



Build the encryption module:

python setup.py install --with-lattice



Verify installation:

python -m securetensorflow.test

Usage

Below is a sample workflow to train a secure model on a medical imaging dataset.

Example: Encrypted Model Training

from securetensorflow import LatticeKey, EncryptedTensor, SecureSGD

# Generate encryption key
key = LatticeKey.gen(dimension=2048, modulus=2**128)

# Load dataset (e.g., MRI scans)
data = load_medical_dataset("mri_dataset")

# Encrypt input tensors
tensor = EncryptedTensor(data, key)

# Initialize model
model = SecureCNN(num_layers=5)

# Train with differential privacy
optimizer = SecureSGD(epsilon=0.005, lr=0.01)
for epoch in range(10):
    grad = homomorphic_gradient(tensor, model)
    model.update(grad, optimizer)
    print(f"Epoch {epoch}: Loss = {model.loss}")

# Save encrypted model
model.save_encrypted("secure_model.stf")

Running Inference

# Load encrypted model
model = load_encrypted_model("secure_model.stf", key)

# Perform secure inference
result = model.infer(EncryptedTensor(test_data, key))
print(f"Prediction: {result.decrypt(key)}")
